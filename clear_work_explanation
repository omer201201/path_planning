In the first part of the mission, my objective was to create a smooth line for a car between the cones.
in the next couple of lines i will break down the code into section and explain it.
section 1: loading the cones coordinates.
I created arrys that stored the x coordinates, y coordinates, and a list of left or right strings.
section 2: seperating the right and left cones.
in this section I created 4 arrays , one for each coordinate (x_left, y_left, x_right ,y_right)
section 3: created two arrays which are the base of the car path by averaging the x,y coordinates.
step 4: created a smooth path based on the points from section 3 using B-spline theqnique.
step 5: plotting the results.

In the second, my objective was to oprimize the path for minimal curvatur while insuring feasibility for veahicle navigation.
I did so by adding two function (objective, constraint), i will explain both of them.
objective gets an array and returns the sum of the squared curvator array, which is measured by the fernet-serret formula for 2D curvature.
constraint makes sure that the car path will not deviate from the center more than we want it to.
The last significant diffrence between the codes is the minimize function, minimize gets objective and constraint and return the optimized path.
